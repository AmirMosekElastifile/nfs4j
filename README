Grizzly-RPC


Motivation
----------


For a couple of years I was successfully using Remote Tea [1] RPC implementation.
The Remote Tea library was implemented for java 1.2. Since then java got
NIO and concurrent utilities. With this features one can write highly salable
applications. Nevertheless java NIO it not friendly at all. There are many
frameworks available to make life easier. One of them is Grizzly [2].

After several attempts to port Remote Tea to grizzly I finally decided to
write my own RPC server engine by reusing as much as possible of original
Remote Tea code. The goal to be able to use stubs generated by Remote Tea
( I do not want to rewrite my RPC server once more ).
