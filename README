Grizzly-RPC


Motivation
----------


For a couple of years I was successfuly using Remote Tea [1] RPC implementation.
The Remote Tea library was implemented for java 1.2. Since then java got
NIO and concurrent utilites. Whith this feaches one can write highly salable
applications. Nevertheless java NIO it not qute friendly. There are many
frameworks avaliable to make life easier. One of them is Grizzly [2].

After severl attemts to port Remote Tea to grizzly I finally decsided to
write my own RPC server engine by reusing as mush as possible of origial
Remote Tea code. The goal to be able to use stubs generated by Remote Tea
( I do not want to rewrite my RPC server once more ).
